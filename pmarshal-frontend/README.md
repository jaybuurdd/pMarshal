/components: This directory contains all the reusable components of your application.

/common: For truly generic components like buttons, modals, and icons that arenâ€™t tied to any specific feature.
/layout: Components that deal with the layout of the application, like navigation bars, sidebars, footers.
/UI: Specific UI components that might be reused across different pages but are more specialized than those in /common.
/pages: Represents the different views/pages of your application. Each file or subdirectory here corresponds to a route in your application.

/services: For handling all external interactions, such as API calls. This helps in managing side effects and centralizing your data fetching logic.

/hooks: Custom hooks for shared logic across components. This might include hooks for fetching data, managing form state, or any custom business logic.

/assets: Contains static resources.

/images: For images and icons used across the application.
/styles: For global stylesheets, common CSS, or SASS/LESS files.
/utils: Utility functions that can be used application-wide. These might include formatters, validators, or any helper functions.

/store: If using Redux or any similar state management library, this folder contains all related files.

/actions: For all Redux actions.
/reducers: For all Redux reducers, typically one file per domain.
/routes: Manages the routing of your application, ideally using a library like React Router. This keeps your routing logic centralized and easy to manage.

/types: If you're using TypeScript, this directory can house all of your type definitions and interfaces.

Additional Tips
Module Resolution: Set up absolute imports to make the import statements cleaner and more manageable. This can be done by configuring the jsconfig.json or tsconfig.json for JavaScript/TypeScript respectively.

Lazy Loading: As your app grows, consider splitting your code at the route level using React.lazy and Suspense for efficient loading.

Testing: Include a directory for tests, often alongside the components or pages they relate to, e.g., ComponentName.test.js.

Environment Files: Maintain different environment files like .env.development, .env.production, etc., for different environments.
